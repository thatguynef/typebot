# Create dynamic backgrounds with Typebot Callbacks

Typebot Callbacks is an awesome feature that lets us bot builders interact with our website based on four events in our chatbots built with Typebot. 

## Warning

Things I want warn you about:

1. The code is half-baked and I created just to show a demo. The only time the image changes is when the user selects a button with "worse" in the text.
2. If a user clicks outside of the popup element, the Typebot widget goes away and there's no way to bring it back unless the user refreshes the page. Not sure how to fix. 
3. Sometimes the Ken Burns animation works, sometimes it doesn't.
4. Sometimes there is white space around the background images. You'll need to fiddle around with CSS to find a solution.

If you have any questions, shoot them in the comments.

## Installation

You'll find the JSON file under "typebot-json" folder where you will need to import the Typebot flow into your own Typebot account.

And then you'll find the super simple webpage with images, CSS, and JS that I used to make the background image dynamic based on user input.
