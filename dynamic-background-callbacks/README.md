# Create dynamic backgrounds with Typebot Callbacks

Typebot Callbacks is an awesome feature that lets us bot builders interact with our website based on four events in our chatbots built with Typebot. 

## Warning

Things I want warn you about:

- If a user clicks outside of the popup element, the Typebot widget goes away and there's no way to bring it back unless the user refreshes the page. Not sure how to fix yet.
